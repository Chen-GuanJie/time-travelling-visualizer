# What is Time-Travelling Visualization?
Time-Travelling Visualization, a technique designed to visualize high-dimensional representations during the deep learning training process. In other words, our method is designed to transform the model training dynamics into an animation of canvas with colorful dots and territories.

- training_dynamic fold is for storing the dataset
- Vis fold is for training the visualization models
- visTool fold is the interactive visualization tool's backend and frontend

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that, the training_dynamic folder stores the training process and the target dataset. 


## Training Process Dataset (the training process of a model)


You can train your classification model and save the training dynamics. For information on the structure of the training dynamics directory and the config file format, refer to the the [dataset's readme document](./training_dynamic/README.md).

üçÉ Training dynamics are also available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yvonne1123/training_dynamic) for you to download. 


# Environment Configuration
1. create conda environment
```
$ cd Vis
$ conda create -n visualizer python=3.7
$ (visualizer) conda activate visualizer
```

2. install pyTorch and CUDA
For setting up PyTorch on that conda environment, use the guidelines provided at [PyTorch's official local installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This guide will help you select the appropriate configuration based on your operating system, package manager, Python version, and CUDA version.

3. install requirements
```
$ (visualizer) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# evaluate subject model
```
$ (visualizer) python subject_model_eval.py
$ (visualizer) ......

$ (visualizer) Successfully evaluated the subject model, and the results are saved in "your model path"/subject_model_eval.json
```

The trainig dynamic performance(testing accuracy and training accuracy) will be store in /training_dynamic/Model/subject_model_eval.json

# Train Your Time-Travelling Visualizer
- visualize the training process
```
$ cd Vis
$ conda activate visualizer
$ (visualizer) python trustvis_tempo.py --start "epoch start number" --end "epoch end number" --content_path "your dataset path"
```
the vis result will be store in /training_dynamic/trustvis_tempo/***.png
the evaluation resulte wiil be store in "your model path"/trustvis_tempo_eval.json

<!-- - visualization without prediction sementics
```
$ cd Vis
$ conda activate visualizer
$ (visualizer) python vis_snapshot.py--start "epoch start number" --end "epoch end number" --content_path "your dataset path"
``` -->
# Run interactive Visualizer Tool
```
$ cd /Tool/server
$ conda activate visualizer
$ (visualizer) ./start_server.sh
```
you will see: 
```
* Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://ip:port

Access the user interface by opening http://ip:port in your web browser.
